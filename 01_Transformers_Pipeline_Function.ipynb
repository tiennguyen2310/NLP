If someone invents something, should he or she be held fully responsible for his or her innovation?  Indeed, the interaction between the two main characters in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein shows the inseparable relationship between knowledge and power, opening up numerous questions about responsibility and ethics for invention.\n",
        "From my personal perspective, while we do not always own the faith of our investigation or invention, we have a responsibility to the consequences that it may bring to the community. In the story, Victor Frankenstein represents the example of an ambitious scientist who is not afraid to dive deep into an unexplored field of knowledge. The desire to overcome the limits of nature and create life demonstrates that humans can achieve considerable power through expertise and creativity. However, this power also has an undeniable responsibility to control possible bad situations. When Victor built the creature, he was not prepared for the consequences of its actions later in the book; rather, he was only interested in proving his own abilities, forgetting that every invention can bring about unpredictable outcomes, a serious shortcoming of the inventor. Victor failed to control and take responsibility for his creation. Alternatively, Victor fled and left the creature to ravage human society, leading to a chain of unrecoverable tragedies. The beast, rejected and despised, became more and more brutal, acting not only out of pain but also out of a lack of love and acceptance.\n",
